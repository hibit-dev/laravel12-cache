# Repository cache in Laravel
In modern web applications, optimizing data retrieval is crucial to improving performance and user experience.

While Laravel offers built-in caching features, in some cases, you may want to implement custom repository caching manually to better control your caching mechanism. This article will walk you through implementing repository caching in Laravel 12, explaining the steps involved and how to achieve better performance in your application.
